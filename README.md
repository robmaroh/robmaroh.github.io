# Hello, I am Robert Allen Marlatt. I am a recent university graduate looking for a career in Computer Science. This repository is a website documenting my portfolio, with links to my GitHub repository, my Linkdin profile, and a form to contact me via email.

# This site was written using Vite and React. It was written using bolt.ai prompts and then uploaded to github. It was then deployed as a netlify app at https://robertmarlattportfolio.netlify.app/#projects.
